# Salty-Spitoon-Text-Game
This was just a silly SpongeBob text-based game that I developed in 2020 when I was beginning to learn Python. 
It took me about a month to develop because I would keep adding new features to test my knowledge of Python concepts as I was learning them.
In order to play this game, you need the NumPy library and Time module otherwise certain features will not function.
There are a few Easter eggs hidden so try and find them (without directly looking at the code).
